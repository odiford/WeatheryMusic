# WeatheryMusic

Weathery Music is a streaming service through which a user can listen to algorithmically generated ambient music with tonal qualities to match the weather at the user's location. This project uses many different programs and languages, but is mainly based in Max, which serves as the audio generator and main engine.

A detailed project report can be found here: https://odenwaldtengineering.com/blog/weathery-music/

Feel free to email me with any comments or questions, and help yourself to the code.
